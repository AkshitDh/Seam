Implemented "Content-aware image resizing- Seam carving" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir,

created a GUI with an improved algorithm using multi-operators. 
Programmed the following modules: Seam removal (using dynamic programming), object protection,

Gradient domain carving (using poisson reconstructor), Saliency (multi-operator, 
and Gaussian pyramid framework to speed up the results by five times.
The project also included T-Map ordering for optimization 
and line detection to compute the intermediate energy map of the image in MATLAB.
